            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-6">Advancements in Materials and Speed</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                One of the most significant drivers of the **future of 3D printing** is the continuous development of new and advanced materials. We're moving beyond basic plastics to include metals, ceramics, composites, and even biological materials. This expansion means **3D printing** can be applied to a much wider range of applications, creating parts that are stronger, lighter, and more functional.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Furthermore, the speed of **additive manufacturing** processes is increasing dramatically. New techniques are emerging that allow for faster deposition and curing, making **industrial 3D printing** viable for mass production, not just custom one-offs. This shift is crucial for its widespread adoption in various sectors.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-6">Transforming Industries: Beyond Prototypes</h2>
